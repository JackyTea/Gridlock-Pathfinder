Currently in alpha stage, more to come.

# Algorithms Utilized

### Brute Force Linear Scan

- Traverses the adjacency matrix to find a path from the start node to the end node.

### Breadth First Search (4-Connectivity)

- Generates an auxiliary adjacency list to find the shortest path via mapping and queuing.

### Breadth First Search (8-Connectivity)

- Generates an auxiliary adjacency list to find the shortest path via mapping and queuing. Takes in to consideration diagonal directions.

# Future Implementations
